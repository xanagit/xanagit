### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">, I am Damien (aka Xanagit)!

---

I am passionate about bringing projects to life from idea to production. Comitment, responsibility, code quality, maintanability and user experience matter to me.

During my 12 yearsâ€™ french and international experience, I designed, implemented and adapted technically sophisticated information systems covering a variety of environments with a large amount of programs and technologies. With track of project management, I demonstrated excellent interpersonal and motivational abilities to develop collaborative relationships among strong-performing teams. Exceptional problem solver I am ablr to quickly master a new skill, technology, or role.

I am happiest when I am able to create, learn, help/mentor, explore and propose new ideas on projects. Currently working as technical leader at U IRIS (IT department of [Magasins U IT Department](https://www.magasins-u.com/accueil))
